  <p class="intro">
	  This is a directory where you can find some of the exercises I've been doing just for learning new things that I can use for my work. Is a better way to be updated and test some ways of coding using Github at the same time through the terminal or desktop app. Doing this small tasks (some are a bit silly) is how I learn faster and understanding how everything works.
